"""Exact matte for artwork on a plain background (concept art, product shots, AI illustrations).

Learned matting models (rembg, U2-Net, ...) smooth away exactly the things this project cares about: hairline chains,
thin blades, fur tips, white-on-white silhouettes.  For clean illustrations on a flat background a geometric matte is
both sharper and more faithful, so it is the default; learned models remain available as a fallback or on request.

Steps
  1. the background colour is the median of the picture's border; a picture whose border is not (nearly) uniform is
     declined (returns None) so busier photographs are left to rembg / the old border matte
  2. "background-like" pixels are flood-filled from the border; the fill is *sealed* against 1-2 pixel gaps in an
     outline, so a broken contour line does not let the background leak into a white dress or a white tail
  3. background-like regions that are enclosed by the object are kept as holes only when they really are holes
     (surrounded by dark or saturated pixels, or very large and perfectly flat) - a white highlight inside a white star
     is not a hole
  4. the outer 1-px ring is defringed (light halo colours are replaced by the colour just inside)

Needs SciPy (already required by the studio extras); without it the caller falls back to the older matte.
